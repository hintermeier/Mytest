**What's the difference between repository and branch in git?**
-A repository is the whole project that I clone on my computer, a branch is a version of the repository.
**What's the staging environment and how does it relate to a commit?**
-Staging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit.
